- The helloworld program is the first program that you learn to code in any language. Simply speaking it causes your console to print hello world. The program starts with a command that tells the processor to include the *stdio.h file* when you run the clang compiler. Then **int main()** is a function that starts every program. The command is then followed with the command **printf("Hello, World!")**. The parantheses indicate content that the console is supposed to print, and content within "" quotations indicate that the function printf contain a string. The program then finishes with command **return 0;** as a convention to signal that the program has ran correctly

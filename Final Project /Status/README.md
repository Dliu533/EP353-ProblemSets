#### What have you done for your project so far?

4/23 3:04 AM: The outside is dark. I have watched spent 6 hours today alone watching bleak JUCE tutorials from The Audio Programmer(tm). He has tried to guide me to the light of the projucer project manager and how to compile a simple program but to no avail. The Jassert error persists, and when I try to launch my EQ program through the juce pluginhost I must push through 3 errors in order for it to launch. However, no changes are ever reflected on my plug-ins. Rain patters on my window as I look at my midnight tea in despair.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

4/29 12:05 AM: A cold wind whistles through my door as I stare at the fictitious progress bar for my project. Twenty hours of work went by and the bar has not moved an inch. Any step forward following a youtube tutorial has yielded a compiling error. I stare at my single juce::SVF filter that is hardcoded at 150 Hz. My future as a plug-in developer is fading fast... my project proposal a distant memory

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

5/15 5:33 PM: In all seriousness this project was the hardest I have ever encountered in Berklee. My peers and I created a group in an attempt to try to figure out JUCE together but none of us had the slightest clue what we were doing. The documentation told us if everything was a class or function and what variable types each thing took, however with no prior C++ experience it was impossible to figure out how and where we should've implemented these items. The actual tutorials themselves on the website taught you how to load a basic project template, but beyond that they simply just let you run wild and do your own thing which was not helpful. I could in theory have budgeted time a little better but I was spending on average twenty hours every week on this project for the month of April, so I do not take responbility for my inability to deliver anything that was remotely close to my initial project example. This is definitely not the last I will see of my coding career, but at this moment if I read another line of C++ code I think I will blow a gasket. Regardless, thank you for your help and patience during your office hours throughout the semester and I hope you will continue to find joy in teaching at Berklee.
